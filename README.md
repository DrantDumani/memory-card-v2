# Memory Card Game v2

A memory card game project made according to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) curriculum.

The [previous version](https://github.com/DrantDumani/memory-card-game/) was developed before the curriculum was updated. It used `create-react-app`, had redundant code, and unnecessary `useEffect` hooks. It also used its own json database for the images.

This version uses [Amiibo API](https://amiiboapi.com/) to fetch its images.
